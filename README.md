## 🛠️ Recently Completed Projects

### 1. [Monthly File Copier](https://github.com/hamtana/MonthlyFileCopier)
A simple yet impactful automation tool created after noticing the manual workload within the Nursing Bureau at Wellington Hospital. Staff were manually copying and renaming daily spreadsheets — so I built an application to automate the process. Users can input the month and year and choose from three tailored copying options.

**Tech Used:** ✔️ Java

### 2. [Email Verifier](https://github.com/hamtana/EmailVerifier)
As part of my contract work, I often send emails containing multiple links. To avoid broken or outdated URLs, I developed a Python script that parses a `.eml` file, extracts every link, and returns the HTTP response codes — saving time and ensuring reliability.

**Tech Used:** ✔️ Python

---

### 3. [Review Engine](https://github.com/hamtana/ReviewEngine)
A lightweight feedback system designed to help businesses receive and act on low-star reviews privately. If a user submits a rating below three stars, they’re prompted to send an email instead — reducing negative public reviews while improving customer experience.

**Tech Used:**  
✔️ Docker · ✔️ React.js · ✔️ Express.js · ✔️ TailwindCSS

## 🚧 Currently Working On
