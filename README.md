# About Me

Hi my name is Hamish Phillips, I am recent graduate from University of Otago with a Bachelor of Arts & Science, majoring in Software Engineering & Music. 
Currently I work as an Administrator for Wellington Regional Hospital, and as an IT contractor trading under Phillips Music & Tech. 

## Recently completed projects

1. [Monthly File Copier](https://github.com/hamtana/MonthlyFileCopier)

**Description:**
While working with the Nursing Bureau at Wellington Hospital, I noticed the team were manuallly copying daily spreadsheets and renaming the files for each day, month and year. Identifying this an area for improvement. I designed this file copier, which takes in input for month and year, with three seperate options catering for three seperate use cases. 

**Technologies used**
✔️ Java

2. [Email Verifier](https://github.com/hamtana/EmailVerifier)

**Description:**
Within my contracting work, I often need to provide links for email based content. I often need to verify these links are not broken before the email is sent. Instead of completing this task manually, I designed a python script, which takes a .eml file as input, checks every direct link in the email and outputs the response code.

**Technologies used:**
✔️ Python

3. [Review Engine](https://github.com/hamtana/ReviewEngine)

**Description:**
A lightweight review-collection system designed to capture customer feedback before it reaches public platforms. When a user submits a review below three stars, the system automatically prompts them to send an email instead. This allows the business to address issues directly and privately, improving customer experience while reducing negative public reviews.

**Technologies used:**
✔️ Docker
✔️ React.js
✔️ Express.js
✔️ TailwindCSS
